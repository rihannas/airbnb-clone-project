## Team Roles

- **DevOps Engineer:**

  - **Bridges development and operations:**
    - Encourages collaboration between siloed teams, even in Agile environments.
  - **Implements CI/CD pipelines:**
    - Builds automated pipelines to accelerate software delivery and maintain stability.
  - **Facilitates reliable deployments:**
    - Collaborates with developers, system administrators, and operations staff to ensure smooth code releases.

- **Quality Assurance (QA):**

  - **Ensures application meets requirements:**
    - Verifies both functional (what the app should do) and non-functional (how it should do it) requirements.
    - Identifies defects that impact functionality, usability, performance, or security.
  - **Executes and analyzes tests:**
    - Runs various types of tests and analyzes results to assess overall application quality.
    - Reports issues and tracks quality metrics across releases.
  - **Creates and manages testing documentation:**
    - Documents test scenarios, protocols, and results to ensure full coverage.
    - Designs QA processes and procedures to prevent defects early in development.

- **Backend Developer:**

  - **Builds and maintains server-side logic:**
    - Develops APIs, databases, and application logic to support frontend functionality.
    - Ensures performance, scalability, and security of server-side applications.
  - **Designs and manages data storage:**
    - Implements and optimizes database schemas for efficient data retrieval and integrity.
    - Works with relational and non-relational databases based on application needs.
  - **Integrates external services and APIs:**
    - Connects the application to third-party services (e.g., payment gateways, email services, cloud storage).
    - Handles authentication, authorization, and other critical integrations.

- **Database Administrator:**
  - **Manages and maintains databases:**
    - Installs, configures, and upgrades database management systems (DBMS).
    - Ensures database availability, reliability, and performance.
  - **Implements security and backup strategies:**
    - Controls user access and permissions to protect sensitive data.
    - Sets up regular backups and recovery procedures to prevent data loss.
  - **Monitors and optimizes performance:**
    - Analyzes and tunes queries, indexes, and system configurations.
    - Tracks database health and resolves performance bottlenecks.
