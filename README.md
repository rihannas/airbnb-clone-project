## üóÇÔ∏è Database Design

This project uses a relational database structure with clearly defined entities and relationships.

### üîë Key Entities

---

Represents all users of the platform, including hosts and guests.

- `id` (Primary Key) ‚Äì Unique identifier for each user
- `email` ‚Äì User's email address (unique)
- `password` ‚Äì Hashed user password
- `role` ‚Äì Defines whether the user is a host or guest
- `created_at` ‚Äì Timestamp when the user was created

---

#### **2. Properties**

Represents listings added by hosts.

- `id` (Primary Key) ‚Äì Unique identifier for each property
- `title` ‚Äì Title or name of the property
- `description` ‚Äì Detailed information about the property
- `location` ‚Äì Address or city of the property
- `price_per_night` ‚Äì Cost per night to stay at the property

**Relationship:**  
A user (host) can create multiple properties.

---

#### **3. Bookings**

Represents reservations made by guests.

- `id` (Primary Key) ‚Äì Unique identifier for each booking
- `user_id` (Foreign Key) ‚Äì Refers to the guest making the booking
- `property_id` (Foreign Key) ‚Äì Refers to the booked property
- `start_date` ‚Äì Check-in date
- `end_date` ‚Äì Check-out date

**Relationship:**  
A booking belongs to one property and one guest.

---

#### **4. Reviews**

Feedback left by guests after a stay.

- `id` (Primary Key) ‚Äì Unique identifier for each review
- `user_id` (Foreign Key) ‚Äì Reviewer (guest)
- `property_id` (Foreign Key) ‚Äì Reviewed property
- `rating` ‚Äì Numeric score (e.g., 1‚Äì5 stars)
- `comment` ‚Äì Text feedback from the guest

**Relationship:**  
A user can review multiple properties. A property can have many reviews.

---

#### **5. Payments**

Tracks payment transactions for bookings.

- `id` (Primary Key) ‚Äì Unique identifier for each payment
- `booking_id` (Foreign Key) ‚Äì Refers to the booking being paid for
- `amount` ‚Äì Total amount paid
- `status` ‚Äì Payment status (e.g., pending, completed)
- `paid_at` ‚Äì Timestamp when payment was made

**Relationship:**  
Each booking has one corresponding payment.

---

#### **6. Amenities**

Represents features or services available at a property.

- `id` (Primary Key) ‚Äì Unique identifier for each amenity
- `name` ‚Äì Name of the amenity (e.g., Wi-Fi, Air Conditioning, Parking)

12. **Search and Filtering**
    - Provide search functionality and filters on properties based on location, price, amenities, and availability to enhance user experience.

## üîê API Security

To ensure the safety and integrity of our application, several key security measures are implemented:

- **Authentication**  
  Users must verify their identity, typically via secure login mechanisms such as JWT tokens or OAuth. This prevents unauthorized access to user accounts and sensitive data.

- **Authorization**  
  After authentication, the system enforces role-based access control to ensure users can only access resources and perform actions they are permitted to. This protects data privacy and restricts operations like property management and payment processing to authorized users only.

- **Rate Limiting**  
  Limits the number of API requests a client can make within a certain time frame to prevent abuse, such as brute force attacks or denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, protecting system availability.

- **Data Encryption**  
  Sensitive data such as passwords and payment information is encrypted in transit (via HTTPS) and at rest, ensuring data confidentiality and compliance with security standards.

- **Input Validation & Sanitization**  
  All incoming data is validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, cross-site scripting), preserving database integrity and application stability.
